## Autofocusing
The Laplacian is often used for edge detection.
The assumption here is that if an image contains high variance then there is a wide spread of responses,
both edge-like and non-edge like, representative of a normal, in-focus image.
But if there is very low variance, then there is a tiny spread of responses, indicating there are very little edges in the image.
